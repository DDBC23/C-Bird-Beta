                    C-Bird’s drone technology enables close-up surveys of all areas of a cargo oil tank. Our drones use
                    onboard lighting,
                    and can be operated from deck. A valuable data set is provided to the attending surveyor,
                    who can make an assessment of COT condition and examine only the critical areas.

                <p>
                    Coated ballast tanks are subject to harsh seawater and should be kept in very good condition. In
                    previous projects,
                    C-Bird has uncovered several unidentified defects and immediate remedial works which could be
                    implemented while still in the dry dock,
                    saving costs for the vessel owner.

                <p>
                    Historically, pipework inspections have been conducted by the attending surveyor physically crawling
                    inside, a challenging, dangerous task. Finally, sufficient close-up imagery can now be obtained
                    without requiring confined space working. C-Bird has completed many large diameter pipework surveys
                    as part of Class requirements.
