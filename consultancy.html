            <p>Taking a drone solution successfully from concept to deployment in harsh industrial environments is a
                serious challenge.
                C-Bird has a proven track record of successfully working with leading drone hardware manufacturers. We
                help engineering teams focus their product development resources on the most important features and
                capabilities. C-Bird’s experience and significant operational expertise can also be called upon to
                support early-stage field-trialling of prototypes in industrial environments.

            <img src="/assets/images/consultancy.jpg" alt="Workers gathered for consultation inside hull">
            <p>Building a drone programme for conducting your own inspections can be challenging without appropriate
                guidance and previous knowledge. C-Bird can close those gaps for drone technology adopters, by bringing
                in our wide-ranging expertise in drone operations.

            <p>We can help create maximum value from your drone program by assessing and recommending the right
                equipment for your operations. We can also develop operations manuals, secure flight permissions, create
                safety frameworks, devise internal company training programs and advise on equipment maintenance
                regimes.</p>
