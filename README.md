## Testing

This site features multiple links to navigate between different pages, open external sites in a new tab and also provide a pdf brochure in a new tab to prevent disruption for the user's viewing experience. Additionally there is a smooth scroll to the top of a page when selecting the appropriate tab on the header nav bar.  These links have been individually tested on desktop and mobile devices and completed without error.

These aforementioned links are presented through the header nav bar, 3 job categories on the home page, various buttons site-wide with 2 different style types, the footer bar and company logo icons where applicable. Each of these features a visual change when hovered over to reaffirm they are a responsive element that can be interacted with by the user.

The contact form provides 4 inputs the user, the first 3 being required fields that are noted with an * next to their label with the final checkbox being optional. The user will either receive confirmation of their submission by means of a "Submitted!" pop up message or be requested to complete one of the mandatory fields as appropriate.

This project was created initially for desktop viewing sizes using pre-approved text content, infographics and images supplied directly by C-Bird. Once the general layout was established for the site it became apparent that this would require significant adjustments for smaller screen sizes to prevent legibility issues for text, pixelation for images and to maintain user friendly content flow and navigation of the site.

With these key points in mind, this site features an adaptive layout for multiple sections across the site, including font size adjustments, to allow for clear groupings of information and a clean and professional visual appearance. These layouts have been implemented primarily for all viewing sizes between 320px and 1900px wide screens but should be functional for widescreen viewing as well.

This has been tested thoroughly using Chrome's inspection tools to identify breakpoints on various viewing sizes followed by further inspection of the live site through a secondary desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile phone to confirm any applicable media queries.
